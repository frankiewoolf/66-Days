# 66-Days

## Description

66 DAYS is a habit focussed nutrition course aimed at using behavioural science and evidence based nutrition to improve eating habits.

Our health and wellness has never been of more interest; the market and spend grows every year; but also has never been of more concern; we are getting fatter, unhealthier and more depressed. 

We believe that the focus and culture around eating is wrong. Diets fail but are the focus for anyone trying to lose weight. When deciding to 'get in shape' people head to a personal trainer who will immediately ask them about what they eat. 
There is too much conflicting advice and people make 'moonshot' decisions like trying to stick to a complex, restrictive and often completely inappropriate 'diet'. The statistics for adherence bear out the failure of this approach.

We're building an online coaching platform that focuses on changing habits and mindset around eating. The principles are backed by science, informed by our founders professional sporting background, incorporate new unfamiliar ways of thinking (anti fragility, Pareto, compounding etc) and focus on incremental, sustainable behavioural change.
We believe food should be joyful and aim to teach people skills and how to create their own sustainable behavioural framework that allows them to eat sensibly and healthily without being restrictive.

To begin with we saw this project as an automated online course delivered via email. Now we're starting with coaching private clients at a much greater cost in order to build out our solution using closer interaction with customers. 
The content is now hosted at our website. A big part of habit formation or improvement is accountability. We provide that by charging money up front, sending a daily habit checker and hope to provide some online coaching or WhatsApp/facebook group support.

If this could be managed via our own app then that would be great - even if it just was the way in which we could easily and most seamlessly send reminders, collect and visualise the Daily Checker. 

The fewer barriers there are to completing habit practice and logging it the better.

We're excited about our concept and believe that in the future it could be a useful healthcare tool for those trying to lose weight or just be a bit healthier. Whether it's a solution for businesses and their employees or something that could be sold in packages for healthcare providers is something we'd like to explore well down the road when we're a bit clearer about what it is.

We'd be fascinated to hear what you think about the project and how you could potentially help out.
