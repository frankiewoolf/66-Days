Initial App Design & Features
=============================

App Features
------------
Important for customers to have accountability to what they said at the start of the program.
Personalized, not generic. Based on experiments - you are allowed to fail, they don’t always work. 

1. **Easily digestible course information**

        Potentially have it linked with the habit progress
        
1. **“News”-esque section for seeing blog posts**

1. **Notifications**

        - notifications of encouragement and reminders but not forceful ones saying to do it precisely then.
        
1. **Positive streak and history of stuff achieved over time**

        - 1st week is setting an overall image goal.       
        - For each habit, each one is two weeks. For each section, the user sets how they apply it.        
        - A list of experiments to apply for themselves. They pick one, but they can make one up.        
        - Ideation session on how to measure progress on diet / wholefoods?
        - Possible future consequences with lots of users – not enough time to organise meetings.        
        - Facebook group to chat to each other and post messages etc.        
        - An online forum system. A big system is difficult to manage.
        
1. **Habits**

        -You can enter your own habits / personalize the data in some way.
        
1. **Schedule of when Ben is doing streams**

        - Booking system to limit numbers on streams to make it more manageable
        - Toggleable Notifications for when events are happening
        
1. **Community chat / forum / thing?**

        - Ability to filter out noise e.g. Reddit esque system with upvotes
        - Alternatively small groups of people where helpful information gets put to everyone
        
1. **App Integration**

        - Can we integrate Facebook into the app somehow?
        
1. **Payment** 

        - Pitching different methods of payment. Don’t worry too much about it, something to bring into it.       
        
1. **Features for Ben**

        - Some system that sends progress information so Ben can look over it and see how well stuff is working
        - Dashboard for how individuals are doing / how people are doing overall.
        - Ways he can edit and add new content into the app.

Research
--------
1. app development frameworks, considering cross platform implementation (Android and iOS)
1. Research web call / video streaming in app with live questions. Better to leave it to a service that knows what they are doing 
        - YouTube Live, for example. How to implement this system.
        
1. Research forums / community chat possibilities.

**Assigned to EVERYONE** - App prototyping / design - based on the above information, design a rough layout for the app. 

Next meeting on 17th October 2018. Have a draft of the app outline completed.

Thoughts
--------
Not every user has a google account, using google drive for backup could be an issue here, unless a google account is mandatory for the app.
