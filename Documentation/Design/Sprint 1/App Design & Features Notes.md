First Meeting with Client
-------------------------

**Core Habits**
1. Eating slowly

1. Drink more water 
        - Less liquid calories from e.g. soft drinks

1. Eat whole foods 
        - Gradually shift ratios of food over time

1. Portion control 
        - Reduce snacking

**Client wants**
- An integrated, localised solution which allows users to complete the course as easily as possible and help develop the four main principles

- Ben notes that while exercise is important, it’s no way near as important as diet and so the main focus should be on developing/correcting the core habits

- Ben specified that trialists haven’t fully experienced the website format yet, bar one who he is awaiting feedback from.
