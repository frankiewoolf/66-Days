App Design & Features
=====================

First Meeting with Client
-------------------------

Problems faced by BEN
---------------------
- Fragmentation of systems
- Barrier of entry isn’t low enough
- Not scalable 
- Note that technical level is just above average, no coding experience, therefore we will have to make a GUI for Ben that he can use.
- Ben has currently made a squarespace website.

**Flexibility of the client** : 
Ben stated that he is relatively flexible, but not after November 5th, however online means of communication are still viable

**What BEN wants**
------------------
- An integrated, localised solution which allows users to complete the course as easily as possible and help develop the four main principles
- Ben notes that while exercise is important, it’s no way near as important as diet and so the main focus should be on developing/correcting the core habits
- Ben specified that trialists haven’t fully experienced the website format yet, bar one who he is awaiting feedback from.

Core Habits
-----------
1. Eating slowly
1. Drink more water 
        - Less liquid calories from e.g. soft drinks
1. Eat whole foods 
        - Gradually shift ratios of food over time
1. Portion control 
        - Reduce snacking

Notification system:
--------------------
Ben focuses on the “Cue → Habit → Reward” system, where the cue is not necessarily an “in the face” notification, but a gentle reminder

APP Features
------------
Important for customers to have accountability to what they said at the start of the program.
Personalized, not generic. Based on experiments - you are allowed to fail, they don’t always work. 

1. Easily digestible course information

        Potentially have it linked with the habit progress
        
1. “News”-esque section for seeing blog posts

1. Notifications

        - notifications of encouragement and reminders but not forceful ones saying to do it precisely then.
        
1. Positive streak and history of stuff achieved over time.

        - 1st week is setting an overall image goal.       
        - For each habit, each one is two weeks. For each section, the user sets how they apply it.        
        - A list of experiments to apply for themselves. They pick one, but they can make one up.        
        - Ideation session on how to measure progress on diet / wholefoods?
        - Possible future consequences with lots of users – not enough time to organise meetings.        
        - Facebook group to chat to each other and post messages etc.        
        - An online forum system. A big system is difficult to manage.
        
1. Habits

        -You can enter your own habits / personalize the data in some way.
        
1. Schedule of when Ben is doing streams

        - Booking system to limit numbers on streams to make it more manageable
        - Toggleable Notifications for when events are happening
        
1. Community chat / forum / thing?

        - Ability to filter out noise e.g. Reddit esque system with upvotes
        - Alternatively small groups of people where helpful information gets put to everyone
        
1. App Integration

        - Can we integrate Facebook into the app somehow?
        
1. Payment 

        - Pitching different methods of payment. Don’t worry too much about it, something to bring into it.       
        
1. Features for Ben

        - Some system that sends progress information so Ben can look over it and see how well stuff is working
        - Dashboard for how individuals are doing / how people are doing overall.
        - Ways he can edit and add new content into the app.

**Initial Ideation Session**
------------------------

To Do:
------
1. Email : Send an email out on the 17th October about whether the project will be going ahead”
1. Next Client Meeting on 24th October MVB 10.am – in two weeks. 
1. Any course materials/outlines/any extra materials he can provide

Research
--------
1. app development frameworks, considering cross platform implementation (Android and iOS)
1. Research web call / video streaming in app with live questions. Better to leave it to a service that knows what they are doing 
        - YouTube Live, for example. How to implement this system.
        
1. Research forums / community chat possibilities.

**Assigned to EVERYONE** - App prototyping / design - based on the above information, design a rough layout for the app. 

Next meeting on 17th October 2018. Have a draft of the app outline completed.

Thoughts
--------
Not every user has a google account, using google drive for backup could be an issue here, unless a google account is mandatory for the app.
