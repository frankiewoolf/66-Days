Prototyping Experiements
========================

Based on the first client meeting notes, we discussed the implementation of possible features of the app. James then designed a prototype app based on these features using Atomic.io, the live app prototype can be seen [here.](https://app.atomic.io/d/7w6BSbwPqoL0)

We performed this prototyping experiment for two main reasons.

- To specify the features that the client wants, which will help us create the requirements for the solution. 
- To test how we could implement the abstract ideas as actual pixels on a screen.
