Understanding the Client
========================


Problems faced by Client
------------------------
- Fragmentation of systems
- Barrier of entry isn’t low enough
- Not scalable 
- Note that technical level is just above average, no coding experience, therefore we will have to make a GUI for Ben that he can use.
- Ben has currently made a squarespace website.

**Flexibility of the Client** : 
Ben stated that he is relatively flexible, but not after November 5th, however online means of communication are still viable

**What Client wants**
---------------------
- An integrated, localised solution which allows users to complete the course as easily as possible and help develop the four main principles
- Ben notes that while exercise is important, it’s no way near as important as diet and so the main focus should be on developing/correcting the core habits
- Ben specified that trialists haven’t fully experienced the website format yet, bar one who he is awaiting feedback from.

Core Habits
-----------
1. **Eating slowly**
1. **Drink more water** 
        - Less liquid calories from e.g. soft drinks
1. **Eat whole foods** 
        - Gradually shift ratios of food over time
1. **Portion control** 
        - Reduce snacking

Notification system:
--------------------
Ben focuses on the “Cue → Habit → Reward” system, where the cue is not necessarily an “in the face” notification, but a gentle reminder
