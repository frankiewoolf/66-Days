Prototyping Experiments
========================

Based on the first client meeting notes, we discussed the implementation of possible features of the app. James then designed a prototype app based on these features using Atomic.io, the live app prototype can be seen [here.](https://app.atomic.io/d/7w6BSbwPqoL0)

We performed this prototyping experiment for two main reasons.
- To specify the features that the client wants, which will help us create the requirements for the solution. 
- To test how we could implement the abstract ideas as actual pixels on a screen.

Clients Thoughts
----------------

**User Journey**
1. The first week is observation of eating habits. At the end of this week, ask the user to enter information about their self image goals.

**Home Page**
1. Include details about the users current streak on the homepage.
1. Likes how simple the to do list is. Thinks that there should be a maximum of four habits on the list for the four keystone habit sections, and then also a seperate habit/action checkbox called "Completed Movement" to check whether the user has done movement today.
1. Create a zoomed out graph of the users overall progress on the Home screen of the app. Tap on this to proceed to a more detailed progress overview.
1. Include the users self-image goal. 

> "Goals need to be who you are going to be, rather than a end point. Instead of having a goal to run a marathon, your goal should be to become a marathon runner."

**Habits**
1. You don't need a description feature for habits - the habit is under one of the four fundamental catergories, and as the user has read all the material and set the habit themselves, this feature is unneeded. Ben was open however to testing this feature with users in the future.
1. The habit app should only be used once daily, ideally in the evening before you go to bed as reflection on the days progress. So, prototype features like having an habit which could be completed once a week or multiple times a day aren't suitable - once a week is too difficult to develop as a habit, and multiple times a day is too frequent for using the app.
1. Don't add the custom habits feature - keep the app simple, and following the course, so that the user doesn't get sidetracked.
1. After two weeks of successfully completing the habit, unlock the feature that the user can change the title of the habit - if they want to increase the habit's difficulty, and increase their progress. Also consider the opposite - if a user fails to complete the habit often, then consider prompting the user to make the habit easier for themselves.

> "The simpler the better."

**Scoring System**
1. Likes the line graph progress of habits, prefers a line graph of the score to a single uptick line graph.
1. Habit stacking that shows the graph increasing in points over time so you can see your progress.
1. Like the idea of the multiplier for compounding the habits as you progress. Score compounds the more habits you complete in a day.
1. The leveling system for habits is too complicated, don't use it.
1. The scoring and streaks should encourage progress and not discourage progress if they are broken.

> "It has to be positive - there is no way of failing"

**Blog Material & Creating Habits**
1. Donâ€™t link the progression of the course to the users score, instead let the user unlock content on a week by week basis. Within each week, unlock the next article immediately after the previous article has been read.
1. Likes that at the end of certain blog posts, there is a prompt for the user to enter their own habit. However, the drop down list feature on the app prototype is a bit too limiting, instead the app should suggest three habit ideas in the blog post text itself, and then the user should type their own habit in in a text field. Ben thought that the personalization of habits was key.

**Notifications**
1. Ben likes the idea of control over notifications of individual habits, espically controlling the time when the notification triggers. He thought that some users would be more likely to use this feature than others, and he didn't want his app to distract those who don't need notifications.
1. Likes the idea of a notification reminding the user to check in once a day, sent in the evening, so that they track their progress.
1. Streaming notifications would be a useful addition.

**Livestream Schedule Feature**
1. Likes that we've left it out entirely (due to its complexity), thinks that email is a good way to go, and will consider YouTube Livestreaming as a possibility for reaching out to users.
1. If we could load a streaming schedule into another section of the app that would be great, and provide streaming notifications.

**Things to Test with Users**
1. What if we could add a feature that prompts them to complete habit that they didn't successfully complete previously?

Conclusions
-----------
Implementing features into the app GUI is deceptively simple, we shall have to be careful to validate this in our user experience tests.

This meeting with the client grounded us in understanding that simplicity in the app design is important, and that the idea of scoring, if implemented positively, could be a great example of compounding in action. From the clients opinions, we are able to refine the requirements of the app. 

We made an enquiry into meeting up with users and showing the prototype to them; however as there are currently only three participants on the course, the client didn't think this as practical. We agreed that we will show our minimum viable product to users (12th December) and gain feedback then.
