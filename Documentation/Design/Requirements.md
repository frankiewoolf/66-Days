Functional Requirements
=======================
These requirements describe how the app and supporting systems will function.
- TIMELINE
- HABITS
- COURSE
- SETTINGS

Timeline Features
-----------------
These functional requirements are to do with how the app changes and progresses over time, from the start of the course until after the course has finished.

### Timeline 0 - Functionality Throughout the Course. ###

- TIMELINE-0.0 At the end of each week, blog posts for the next week must unlock. This is also true for all future weeks until the end of the course. (This stops the user from rushing through all the content.)
- TIMELINE-0.1 Within the blog posts for the current week, new blog post content is unlocked as the user finishes reading the previous blog post. This continues until the user runs out of material for the current week, and they then have to wait until the next week to be able to access more.

### Timeline 1 - The First Week. ###

- TIMELINE-1.0 The app must greet a new user with a welcoming message and tutorial guide. (The first tutorial blog post shall explain features of the app to new users, and the users first experiment - self observation of diet for a week, through taking photos regularly.)
- TIMELINE-1.1 The app must have a habit for the first week, which the user can check to show they've taken photos of their meals. (This familiarises the user with the habit checking system and scoring system.

### Timeline 2 - The Second Week. ###

- TIMELINE-2.0 At the end of the first week, the app must allow the user to enter a **self-image goal**. (This self image goal is displayed on the home screen, and is the underlying motivation for completing the habits.)
- TIMELINE-2.2 At the end of the first week, the user sets their first habit around the theme of **eating slowly**. They set the habit by reading a blog post, and being prompted with ideas for how to implement the habit, and then typing out their own implementation into a text input.
- TIMELINE-2.3 At the end of the first week, the food observation habit stops running, and the users first self defined habit replaces it.

### Timeline 3 - The Third Week ###

### Timeline 4 - The Fourth Week ###

- TIMELINE-4.0 At the end of the third week, the user sets their first habit around the theme of **drinking water**. They set the habit by reading a blog post, and being prompted with ideas for how to implement the habit, and then typing out their own implementation into a text input.

### Timeline 5 - The Fifth Week ###

### Timeline 6 - The Sixth Week ###

- TIMELINE-6.0 At the end of the fifth week, the user sets their first habit around the theme of **portion control**. They set the habit by reading a blog post, and being prompted with ideas for how to implement the habit, and then typing out their own implementation into a text input.

### Timeline 7 - The Seventh Week ###

### Timeline 8 - The Eight Week ###

- TIMELINE-8.0 At the end of the fifth week, the user sets their first habit around the theme of **eating whole foods**. They set the habit by reading a blog post, and being prompted with ideas for how to implement the habit, and then typing out their own implementation into a text input.

### Timeline 9 - The Ninth Week ###

### Timeline 10 - The Final Week ###

Habit Features
--------------
These functional requirements are to do with how habits work, in what way they are managed and displayed.

- HABIT-0.0 Habits must be displayed as a checklist on the home screen of the app (this allows the user to easily check off their progress at the end of the day, making the barrier for tracking their progress as low as possible).

Course Features
------------------
These functional requirements are to do with how the app displays and curates course content.

- COURSE-0.0 Course content must be stored externally on a website and then pulled into the app for display. (This means that Ben can edit the course content without having to modify or update the app itself.)
- COURSE-0.1 Course content must be readable, that is a font-size greater than 8px on mobile devices.
