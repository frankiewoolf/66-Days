Development Testing

Select a core function/component of the system, providing a short justification of why you have selected that particular element. This would typically be a crucial method at the heart of the system. Draw up a table detailing the test cases used to fully and comprehensively test that function/component. We are looking for specific input and output data values. You should aim to provide as complete testing coverage as possible of that core component. This section must not exceed a single sheet of A4 â€“ we are more interested in quality than quantity !
