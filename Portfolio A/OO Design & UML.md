OO Design & UML
---------------

Provide one example of a static and a dynamic UML modelling aspect of your system.

Together with the diagram provide a section of written text that describes:

- The context within which you created this diagram. This might for example be the use case that you were working on or modelling.
- The motivation behind your choice of this particular aspect. This might be due to a challenging design decision or uncertainty about the relationship of domain concepts.
- A brief reflection on the modelling choices you made and any knowledge that you gained from this model.

This section must not exceed 3 pages of A4, including the diagrams and their respective analysis.
