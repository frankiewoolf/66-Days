## Quantitative Survey for Useability Requirements
We talked to ten students and adults about their experience using the app and gathered quantitative survey data from them on its key usability metrics. The survey questions were based on our agreed design requirements, to verify to Ben we’d delivered what we’d agreed. The results from this survey showed that the app had excellent useability, with some disagreement over the overall aesthetic feel. If we were to run the survey again we would change some of the 5 option questions from the format of “Strongly Agree, Agree, …” to “Yes / No” questions, for example “Did the app freeze for 3 second or longer periods?”

One user was unable to test the app fully as different features of the app depended on internet access, which cut out shortly after they installed it. This resulted in a “Neutral” response for app functionality, as the user understood that they needed internet access to use the app fully. We decided to take this feedback forward and add various caching systems so the user doesn’t need internet to use the app properly, which should spare users confusion in the future.

## Agile Iterative Development Combined with Evaluation
We performed minor evaluations of the app and website throughout the product, as we had fortnightly meetings and feedback sessions with Ben throughout the project. These took a far more qualitative form of feedback; demoing our work and taking notes of things to fix or improve, we were later able to create work packages accordingly and add them to our product backlog. Features implemented from this feedback include many fixes to minor bugs and errors, a dark mode for the app and a new scoring system for the habits score chart. This iterative evaluation process meant that by the time came for major release deadlines, Ben already knew much about how the project worked and was happy with its functionality for the release.

## An In-Depth Final Review 
In our final meeting with Ben, we tasked him to do simple tasks using the website and app without giving him prompts. From this we learned we needed to make a few simple changes to the online course editor and the mobile course library display; importantly, displaying the week number by the habit you are editing and a useful addon would be rendering markdown text within the app. Fortunately, these were simple fixes which we were able to implement quickly. We decided for future proofing to include some simple documentation explaining how the website works, focusing on the course editor and the Habit Type option which caused Ben some difficulty.
