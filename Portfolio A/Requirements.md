Requirements
------------

Provide a comprehensive list containing all of the system stakeholders you are able to identified. For each stakeholder provide a suitable name and single (short) descriptive sentence. Include a high-level use-case diagram(s) showing the key actors who engage with the system and the primary functional goals they may wish to achieve. Note: Not all stakeholders will appear as actors in the use-case diagrams ! Not all actors are human !!!

For a core set of the use-case goals, list the sequence of steps involved in achieving each goal. Within this set, describe at least one alternative and one exceptional flow.

Select one goal that you believe to be of paramount importance or of particular interest. For this goal, decompose the flow steps into a set of atomic requirements. Specify both functional and non-functional requirements as structured natural language, using a clear and simple template structure. It is up to you to decide what fields to include in your template, but you are advised to keep things simple (whilst providing as much detail). As with many things, this is a delicate balance to reach !

To give you an idea of the complexity and detail expected in your portfolio, this whole section should occupy approximately 4 pages of A4.
