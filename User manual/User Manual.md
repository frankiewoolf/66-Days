# 66 Days mobile application user manual

## Getting started
Upon start up of the app you will be greeted with the sign-in screen. Here you can chose to sign-in with you gmail account (if you have purchased access to the 66 Days course content), or you sign-in anonymously, should you wish to just track your own custom habits.

Once you have signed into the app, you will be taken to the home page. The homepage displays multiple cards which you can scroll between to help you with your journey through habit tracking. These cards are compact versions of more detailed sections of the app, which include; your score chart, your currently tracked habits and your statistics. Should you decide that you do not want one of the cards on the home screen, then you can swipe to dismiss them.

![Homepage 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simon-wh/66-Days/master/User%20manual/Images/The%20home%20page%202.png)

At the bottom of the home screen is the navigation bar, which can flip you between the course content and the home page, and in the top left is a button which allows you to access the sidebar, where you can explore other areas of the app.

## Course content
Unauthorised or anonymous users are not permitted to access the course content of 66 days. Should you wish to change this, then please get in contact with the app owner.

If, however, you are allowed to view the course content then when you track your first habit, your journey begins! You will go through each day trying to track each habit you set yourself, and be introduced to a new habit every other week, with the option to update your current habit each week. Weeks that are highlighted in orange are ones that have already tracked the necessary habits for, the green week is the one in which you are currently on, and greyed out weeks are ones which you will have to track for a little bit longer in order to unlock.

For each given week, you are prompted to set up you own experiment and environment design. By tapping on one of the weeks shown above, you will be presented with the overview of the current week, which includes what experiment you are following, alongside the environment design. Simple select one of the experiments to chose it for that week. Simply pull down until the refresh icon appears to refresh the course content.

## Managing your habits
Whether you have selected a given experiment from the course content, or wish to pursue your own personal habit, managing your habits is made easy with 66 days. By selecting the habit manager from the side bar, it will take you to an overview of all your currently tracked habits. Here you can select a specific habit for more information, or add your own custom habit.

By selecting a certain habit, you will be presented with all the statistics of that habit. This overview shows all the days in which you successfully tracked that habit, and gives you the option too recheck a habit if you forgot to check the habit on that day, when in fact you actually completed. There is also a graph which shows what days you did and didn't track this habit, along with the habits streaks and statistics beneath it.

In the top right of the habit overview there is an icon which allows you to edit a habit when tapped. Here you can fully control exactly how you wish to track this habit, including the title, experiment, environment design and fully-fledged control over the notification system. Simply tap the time to edit the time of the notification, the days to edit the days and the slider to enable/disable the notification.

## Viewing your statistics
Another tab on the side bar is the statistics page. Here you can view your graph which shows your progress overtime. The more consistent you are with tracking your habits, the more the graph goes up, leave it too long however, and you will see your progress begin to slowly decline. Furthermore you can view what streaks you had going for this habit, alongside some extra statistics beneath this. Most are self-explanatory, but the perfect days stat describes the days in which you checked off every single habit which you were tracking.

## Managing settings
The settings page allows for quite and easy changes to aspects of the apps that don't involve habit. Here you can change whether you use the light or dark mode colour scheme. You can also change when/if you receive the end of day habit notification. This will remind you to check off all your habits before you go to bed. When you open the home page after this time, you will be shown a selection of cards which you swipe in order to check off/dismiss any remaining unchecked habits.
